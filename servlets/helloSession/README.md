# Hello Session!
This project contains a demonstration of the use of [HttpSession](http://docs.oracle.com/javaee/6/api/javax/servlet/http/HttpSession.html) for keeping the state of the interaction on the server side. This project also shows how to use JSP and redirections.

Deploy your code to a [Jetty](http://www.eclipse.org/jetty/) server with ```gradle jettyEclipseRun```. Then, open the page at [http://localhost:8080/login.html](http://localhost:8080/login.html). Use ```admin:1234``` for login.
