# Hello life cycle!
This project shows how ```init()``` and ```destroy()``` methods are used in servlets. 

Deploy your code to a [Jetty](http://www.eclipse.org/jetty/) server with ```gradle jettyEclipseRun```. Then, open the static HTML document served at [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/) which sends requests to the servlet at [http://localhost:8080/hi](http://localhost:8080/hi).
