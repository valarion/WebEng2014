# Lab 2. REST
This laboratory will consist of a series of tasks designed to familiarize you with REST related technologies

Tasks:

* Create a REST server that acts as a repository of ToDos following CRUD style (GET, PUT, DELETE, POST).
* Test that the REST server works as expected with the tool [SoapUI](http://www.soapui.org/). The REST server must include a saved [SoapUI project](http://www.soapui.org/Working-With-Projects/concept.html). 
* Create a new version of your ToDo Web application that uses the REST server as its ToDo repository.
* Edit [rest.csv](rest.csv) and add your NIA and links to both applications.
* Make a pull request. If your appliacations are OK, the pull request will be accepted. Otherwise the pull request will be rejected and you will be informed of the required fixes.

Remember, to do these tasks is mandatory!
