# Lab 1. RCP/SOAP
This laboratory will consist of a series of tasks designed to familiarize you with SOAP related technologies

Tasks:

* Create a SOAP server that acts as a repository of ToDos (add ToDo, remove ToDo, list ToDo) and
exposes these operations as three different methods of the same interface.
* Test that the SOAP server works as expected with the tool [SoapUI](http://www.soapui.org/). The SOAP server must include a saved [SoapUI project](http://www.soapui.org/Working-With-Projects/concept.html). 
* Create a new version of your ToDo Web application that uses the SOAP server as its ToDo repository.
* Edit [soap.csv](soap.csv) and add your NIA and links to both applications.
* Make a pull request. If your appliacations are OK, the pull request will be accepted. Otherwise the pull request will be rejected and you will be informed of the required fixes.

Remember, to do these tasks is mandatory!
