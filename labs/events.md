# Lab 3. Events
This laboratory will consist of a series of tasks designed to familiarize you with WebSocket related technologies

Tasks:

* Create a WebSocket server that acts as a repository of ToDos. Subprotocols such as [WAMP](http://wamp.ws/) or frameworks such as [Atmosphere](https://github.com/Atmosphere/atmosphere) can be used.
* Add a [JUnit] test that verifies that the WebSocket server works.
* Create a new version of your ToDo Web application that uses the WebSocket server as its ToDo repository.
* Edit [events.csv](events.csv) and add your NIA and links to both applications.
* Make a pull request. If your appliacations are OK, the pull request will be accepted. Otherwise the pull request will be rejected and you will be informed of the required fixes.

Remember, to do these tasks is mandatory!
